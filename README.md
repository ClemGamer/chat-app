# chat-app
a simple chat application for practicing websocket

## server
The server is made with Golang. It is learning from the example of Golang's websocket package [Gorilla](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/tree/main/examples/chat).
I modified the example code to use the Gin framework and allow the server to communicate with my client.

## client
The client is made with Unity.
It is a simple app designed to simulate two users sending messages to each other.
